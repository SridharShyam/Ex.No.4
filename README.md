## Aim:
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 2 with Comparative Analysis Prompt, Universal Prompt, Structures Prompt Refinements and Prompt Size Limitations

### Explanation:
Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
### Procedure:
### 1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
**Scenario:**
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.

**Target Audience:**
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.

**Main Objectives:**
•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.

•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.

•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.

•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.


### 2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
**Idea Generation Prompts:**

•	Prompt: “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?” Generated Ideas:

•	Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance.

•	Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures.

•	Energy usage optimization by automating the switching of machines on/off based on demand.

•	Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and control of machinery.

**Persona and Context Prompts:**

•	Prompt: “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?” Generated Context:
•	The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.
•	The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training required for operators.

## Output:

### Comparative Analysis Prompt

**Prompt:** “Compare the benefits of IoT-based automation systems with traditional manual monitoring in manufacturing.”

**Response:** IoT automation enables real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and energy optimization, which increases efficiency and reduces downtime. Manual monitoring depends on human supervision, leading to delays, higher error rates, and more frequent breakdowns. Thus, IoT automation is more efficient and reliable for modern manufacturing.

### Universal Prompt

**Prompt:** “Explain how predictive maintenance improves productivity in a factory setting.”

**Response:** Predictive maintenance uses AI and sensors to forecast potential equipment failures. By detecting issues early, it reduces downtime, prevents costly repairs, and keeps machinery running at peak performance, thereby improving overall productivity.

### Structured Prompt Refinement

**Prompt:** “What should the system include to support operators? Mention UI features, training needs, and monitoring aspects.”

**Response:**

UI Features: A dashboard showing performance metrics, energy consumption graphs, and maintenance alerts.

Training Needs: Minimal training is required due to an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Monitoring: Instant alerts and real-time updates about machine health and performance.

### Prompt Size Limitation

**Prompt:** “Describe the role of IoT in manufacturing in less than 30 words.”

**Response:** IoT enables real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and optimization of processes, leading to improved efficiency, reduced downtime, and lower energy consumption.
